# Problem 1. Research Writing

## a. Transparent statistical methods

In part one, they used a pearson correlation test, with the word "correlation" as evidence of so. In part two, they used a one-way ANOVA since there are multiple groups they are testing for one factor or variable, nitrogen load.

## b. More info needed

If you use an ANOVA test, you'll know that two groups are different, but you won't know which ones are different. Two things that could be included to add context to the anova is an F statistic, which is used to evaluate significance and helps us find our p-value to determine if we should reject or accept the null. Another important test to include is a shapiro-wilks normality test, to determine normality which is important since the assumption of an anova requires a normal distribution of the variables.

## c. Suggestions for rewriting

The average load of nitrogen in kg per year is significant between sources (urban land, atmospheric deposition, fertilizer, wastewater treatment, and grasslands) (one-way ANOVA, F = F distribution, df = degrees of freedom, p = 0.02). Sites located farther from from the headwaters have a higher annual total nitrogen load than those closer (Pearson correlation test, r = correlation coefficient, p = 0.03, a = significance level, n = sample size).

# Problem 2. data visualization

```{r}
#read in data
sst <- read.csv("/Users/evancooper/Desktop/GitHub/ENVS-193DS_spring-2025_final/data/SST_update2023.csv")
```

## a. Cleaning and Summarizing

```{r}
#clean and wrangle
sst_clean <- sst |> #change df
  clean_names() |> 
  mutate(year = year(date),
         month = month(date),
         month = month(date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)) |> #get month and year in seperate column
  select(year, month, temp) |>
  filter(year %in% 2018:2023) |> 
  group_by(year, month) |> 
  summarize(mean_monthly_sst = mean(temp)) #find mean of sst and make column

sst_clean |> 
  slice_sample(n = 5) #show 5 columns

# Show structure
str(sst_clean)
```

## b. Visualize the Data

```{r}
#visualize
sst_clean |> 
  filter(year %in% 2018:2023) |>
  mutate(year = factor(year)) |> 
ggplot(aes(x = month,
           y = mean_monthly_sst,
           color = year,
           group = year))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  labs(x = "Month",
       y = "Mean monthly sea surface temperature (°C)") +
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_color_manual(values = colorRampPalette(c("skyblue", "darkblue"))(6))+
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.2, 0.7),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    axis.line = element_line(color = "grey50"))
```

# Problem 3. Data Analysis

## a. Response variable

```{r, echo=FALSE}
nest_boxes <- read.csv("/Users/evancooper/Desktop/GitHub/ENVS-193DS_spring-2025_final/data/occdist.csv") |> 
  clean_names()
```

The ones and zeros in the data sheet mean that the nest was either occupied or unoccupied by that species, the common starling, tree martin, parrot, or empty.

## b. Purpose of study

Swift parrots are native and at risk of extinction in Australia. They also rarely nest in the same area twice, meaning there's competition with other species. Tree martins and Starlings are competitors to Swift Parrots. While there is no study of the aggressiveness of swift parrots, the authors have seen starlings destroy swift parrot eggs.

## c. Difference in “seasons”

The seasons are the summer breeding season of 2016 and 2019, the first is when the nest boxes were first deployed, and 2019 when they were established.

## d. Table of models

4 models total:

| Model number | Season | Distance to forest edge | Model description |
|:------------:|:------:|:-----------------------:|:-----------------:|
|      1       |        |                         |    Null Model     |
|      2       |   X    |                         |      Season       |
|      3       |        |            X            |   Edge Distance   |
|      4       |   X    |            X            |  Saturated Model  |

```{r, include=FALSE}
clean_data <- nest_boxes |> 
  select(box, season, edge_distance, box_occupant)

sp_data <- nest_boxes |> 
  select(box, season, edge_distance, sp)

  str(clean_data)
  slice_sample(clean_data, n = 10)
```

## e. Run the models

Write your code to run all your models. Do not display any output.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
model4 <- glm(
  sp ~ 1 + edge_distance + season,
              data = sp_data,
  family = "binomial")
model1 <- glm(sp ~ 1,
              sp_data,
              family = "binomial")
model2<- glm(sp ~ 1 + season,
              sp_data,
              family = "binomial")
model3<- glm(sp ~ 1 + edge_distance,
              sp_data,
              family = "binomial")
```

## f. Check the diagnostics

Check your diagnostics for all models using simulated residuals from the `DHARMa` package.

Display the diagnostic plots for each model.

```{r}
#diagnistics
plot(simulateResiduals(model2))
plot(simulateResiduals(model3))
plot(simulateResiduals(model4))
plot(simulateResiduals(model1))
```

## g. Select the best model

Using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) from the `MuMIn` package, choose the best model.

```{r}
#Choosing the best model
AICc(model1,
     model2,
     model3,
     model4)
```

The best model as determined by Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) is the saturated model (model 4). The response variable was if there was swift parrot occupancy using the nest box, and the predictors were the season (2016 or 2019) and distance to the edge of the forest.

## h. Visualize the model predictions

Create a plot showing model predictions with 95% confidence intervals and the underlying data.

Show and annotate all code. Show the output.

```{r}
#prediction
model4_pred <- ggpredict(model4,
          terms = c("edge_distance", "season")) |> 
  rename(distance = x, season = group)
ggpredict(model4,
          terms = c("edge_distance", "season"))

# plot visual
ggplot(sp_data,
       aes(x = edge_distance,
           y = sp,
           color = as.factor(season)))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line(data = model4_pred,
            aes(x = distance,
                y = predicted))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,1))+
  labs(title = "Predicted Nest Box Occupancy of Swift Parrot",
       y = "Swift Parrot Occupancy",
       x = "Forest Edge Distance (meters)",
       color = "Season",
       caption = "figure 1")+
  scale_color_manual(values = pnw_palette("Sunset2", 2))+ #color
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) #take out grid

```

## i. Write a caption for your figure.

Figure 1. Predicted Nest Box Occupancy of Swift Parrot

This figure shows the probability of a Swift Parrot occupying a nest box based on distance to forest edge separated by seasons (2016, 2019). The points are whether the nest was occupied or was empty color coded based on the season. The lines represent the probability of a nest box being occupied at that distance using a generalized linear model prediction with a binomial response variable.

Data source: Stojanovic et al. (2020), “Do nest boxes breed the target species or its competitors?” Restoration Ecology.

## j. Calculate model predictions

Calculate the predicted probabilities of Swift Parrot nest box occupancy with 95% at 0 m from forest edge and 900 m from forest edge for each level in `season`.

Show and annotate all code. Display the output.

```{r}
mod4pp <- ggpredict(model4,
                                   terms = c("edge_distance [0,900]", "season"))

mod4pp
```

## k. Interpret your results

Its been observed that distance to forest edge and the seasons have an impact on the probability of Swift Parrots occupying nest boxes, and we can reject the null hypothesis. Figure 1 shows a trend in the probability of occupancy, that the closer the nest box is to the forest edge, the higher the probability of a Swift Parrot occupying it. We can also see that there were more nest boxes occupied in 2016 than in 2019.

According to the predicted probability table there was a 48% chance of Swift Parrot occupancy 0 meters from the forest edge in 2016, and a decrease to 30% in 2019.

At 900 meters from the forest edge the probability of occupancy was 0.12% in 2016, and 0.06% in 2019.

Biological trends in figure 1 show that Swift parrots prefer nest boxes closer to the forest edge, and have a higher rate of occupancy with nest boxes that are new instead of established. One hypothesis is that their less aggressive behavior could be a reason for low occupancy with established nest boxes.

# Problem 4. Affective and exploratory visualizations

## a. compare and contrast

![Exploratory Visualization](images/5DC2FDE4-F331-418D-8405-D6130DFD688B.png){fig-align="left" width="600"}

In my exploratory data set I started off by comparing my workout ***duration*** to hours of sleep, while my affective visual compares workout ***type*** to hours asleep. The only similarity is the large standard deviation between exercises, due to the low number of observations.

Patterns in the visualization that are consistent are the push and rest days having the most sleep. Its hard to see trends in the data since the exploratory visualization is missing points and isn't focused on the mean of the data, while the affective visualization showcases the mean with the ridges.

Advice I gathered from my peers was how simple the data was to follow and easy to digest for my affective visualization which I chose not to over-complicate with more data.

## Thank you

I wanted to thank you for help this quarter, I truly feel like I learned an insane amount of coding. I did my best to knock the final out of the park in order to show that even with a few of stumbles I still had the capability to succeed and pass the class.
